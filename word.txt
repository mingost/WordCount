Not a day goes by when I don’t miss my father’s huge character or my beloved sister’s gentle brown eyes, 
but I know that I will be with them one day for an eternity. 
What I have now is so precious and so fleeting that I must grasp the joy in every moment I can, and treat it as the gift that it is.
